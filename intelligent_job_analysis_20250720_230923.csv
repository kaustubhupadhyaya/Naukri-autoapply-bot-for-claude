His 2 years of experience at Eli Lilly is valuable. The experience requirement (1-4 years) is a good match, scoring 10 points. The location flexibility (Bangalore preferred, but remote/hybrid options available) adds to the appeal, earning 15 points in the company score. His core skills cover many requirements, particularly in Python, SQL, AWS, and ETL processes. However, the technology stack match is only moderate, he scores well on Python, SQL, AWS components, and CI/CD, but lacks experience with some technologies mentioned in the job description like Hive, Cloudera, and Oozie. This results in a technology score of 37. His learning skills demonstrate a proactive approach to skill development.  The role is a perfect match for a Data Engineer, adding 10 points. The overall score of 72 falls within the good match range (60-75) for a candidate with 2 years of experience. While the company is a service company, the remote option compensates somewhat. Applying is recommended, but he should highlight his transferable skills and express enthusiasm for learning any missing technologies during the interview process.","['Hive', 'Cloudera', 'Oozie', 'Hadoop', 'Spark (although learning it)', 'Kafka (although learning it)', 'Snowflake (although learning it)', 'Databricks (although learning it)']",medium,Data Engineer,Netlink Software Pvt Ltd is looking for Data Engineer to join our dynamic team and emba...,,1753032944.423051,True,
