"""The seam between chatdrawer (v2) and the v1 answer stack it reuses rather than re-derives.

v1 (run_naukri_unattended.py) already has a working answer stack: safe-default policy tables,
a local-proxy/OpenCode-Zen/Gemini LLM chain with a session memo, and stale-question guards.
Rebuilding that would be pure risk for no gain, so v2 takes it by injection at install() time
instead of importing run_naukri_unattended (which would be a circular import — that module
imports this package to call install()).
